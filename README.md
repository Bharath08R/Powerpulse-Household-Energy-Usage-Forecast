# Powerpulse-Household-Energy-Usage-Forecast
‚úÖ Project Overview
Domain: Energy and Utilities
Objective: To predict household energy consumption using machine learning models based on historical usage patterns.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

üîç Approach
We followed a structured machine learning pipeline tailored for beginners, ensuring clarity and interpretability at every step:

Data Understanding & Exploration

Loaded and parsed the "Individual Household Electric Power Consumption" dataset.

Inspected data types, missing values, and time granularity.

Data Preprocessing

Converted string-based numerical fields to float.

Filled missing values using forward fill method.

Parsed and indexed datetime from Date and Time columns.

Feature Engineering

Extracted meaningful features from datetime:

hour, day, month, year, weekday

Added placeholders for future integration of external weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity).

Dropped low-correlation features such as Global_intensity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Plotted energy usage trends over time.

Generated a correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships.

Visualized outliers using boxplots.

Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to quantify anomalies.

üìà Data Analysis
Patterns Observed:
Energy usage has distinct daily and hourly patterns.

Global_active_power shows variability across months and days of the week.

Strong correlation between Global_active_power and Global_reactive_power.

Outliers are present in features like Voltage and Sub_metering, warranting careful preprocessing.

Visual Insights:
Time-series plots showed increasing/decreasing trends in power consumption.

Heatmaps helped identify features with potential predictive power.

Boxplots helped detect skewness and outlier density in key variables.

ü§ñ Model Selection and Evaluation
Models Used:
Linear Regression (Baseline model)

Random Forest Regressor (Ensemble model)

Gradient Boosting Regressor (Boosted ensemble)

Evaluation Metrics:

Model	MAE	RMSE	R¬≤
Linear Regression	~0.31	~0.48	~0.53
Random Forest	~0.21	~0.35	~0.78
Gradient Boosting	~0.22	~0.37	~0.75
Note: Metrics are based on a sample of 100 predictions and may vary slightly depending on system specs or preprocessing.

Observations:
Random Forest performed the best in terms of R¬≤ and error metrics.

Linear Regression underfit the data due to its simplicity.

Gradient Boosting offered competitive accuracy with slightly higher computational cost.

üí° Insights and Recommendations
Key Insights:
Hour of day and day of week are strong predictors of energy usage.

Seasonal trends (month and year) also influence consumption patterns.

Outliers may represent unusual consumption behavior (e.g., holidays or device malfunctions).

Recommendations:
Feature Enrichment:

Integrate external weather data (temperature, humidity) for more context-aware modeling.

Include appliance-level data if available to identify energy-heavy devices.

Model Enhancement:

Explore LSTM or ARIMA models for time-series forecasting.

Apply hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for better generalization.

Use Case Deployment:

Deploy models into dashboards (using Streamlit) for homeowners to monitor and optimize usage.

Offer alerts or recommendations when predicted usage exceeds defined thresholds.

Environmental Benefits:

Use predictions to encourage off-peak energy usage.

Promote energy conservation habits through real-time insights.
